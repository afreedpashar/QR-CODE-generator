## Generating QR Code

To generate a QR code using Python, you can use the `qrcode` library to create the QR code and the `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) to display or save it.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have both `qrcode` and `PIL` installed. If not, you can install them using:
pip install qrcode
pip install Pillow
